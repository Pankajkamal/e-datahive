This becomes apparent when trying to incorporate both\u00a0<strong>SEO and branding<\/strong>\u00a0into a strategy. This process is finicky to say the least. On the one side, SEO deals with the placement of keywords and phrases. On the other side, branding deals with company loyalty and culture. Incorporating both sides dilutes the prominence of both. But eliminating one or the other may not meet all strategic and marketing goals.<\/p>\n<p>Once again, it should be emphasized that SEO is a series of guidelines rather than an exact science. Having said that, the following recommendation can be used to satisfy both sides of the equation.\u00a0<strong>In general, keywords and phrases (i.e. SEO) should remain the focus of any early-stage company, while the incorporation of company branding should appear later in the evolution.<\/strong>\u00a0This is simply a general statement and should not be taken word for word.<\/p>\n<p>The reasoning is pretty straightforward. At first, no-one knows the name of your company, but perhaps they are searching for your products or services. In other words, you want to target keywords and phrases that focus around your offering rather than your company. As you build loyalty and credibility, branding becomes more important. It\u2019s at this point that you may want to incorporate corporate messaging to strengthen the relationship with customers and instill trust in your brand.<\/p>\n<p>One final thought about branding: if a searcher types in the name of your company, they are likely to find your website anyways. This is due mostly to anchor text and back-links. Therefore, optimizing for the company name is rather insignificant in most cases.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SEO is not an exact science.
