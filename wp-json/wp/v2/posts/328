Quality content should attract links. The exchange of links is nothing more than a mutual agreement to unjustifiably promote others\u2019 content with the end goal of promoting your own.

Whether this is true or not is hard to say. One thing is for certain though: inbound linking strategies should NOT be centered around reciprocal linking. This manufactured form of link creation is not well-received and is ultimately a waste of time. Instead, focus on creating unique, high-quality content in a given niche.
